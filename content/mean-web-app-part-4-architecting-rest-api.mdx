## Introduction
In the rapidly changing landscape of web development, there's an increasing emphasis on building 
applications that are not only robust and scalable but also maintainable. The key to achieving this 
lies in adopting architectural patterns that foster clarity and intuitive code organization. The 
**3-tier architecture** is divided into three strategic layers: **Presentation**, **Business Logic**, 
and **Data Access**. With [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), one of Node.js's premier web 
application frameworks, the result is a powerhouse for streamlined RESTful API development. Yet, the 
journey doesn't end there. A component-based folder structure elevates this setup, promoting enhanced 
code reusability and a systematic approach to organizing functionalities.

While [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) is praised for its flexibility, arising from its 
unopinionated design, this trait can sometimes be a double-edged sword. Without a defined structure, 
it's easy to spiral into a realm of inconsistent and tangled codebases, especially in collaborative 
environments. Fear not; this article is crafted with a singular purpose: to steer you towards 
leveraging the 3-tier architecture and a component-based directory seamlessly within your Express.js 
REST API projects.

## Structured Layering: 3-Tier Architecture

<AdaptiveImage alt={'3-tier architecture for REST API implementation'} src={'/img/blog/9/1.webp'} width={768} height={540} />

The 3-Tier Architecture, or 3-Layer Architecture, is a design pattern that divides an application 
into three functional areas or tiers. This separation into distinct layers creates a robust framework 
that allows developers to modify or add to a layer without impacting the rest of the system. The 
three primary tiers usually include:

- **The Routing Layer** is the application's front end, handling user interactions within a REST API 
framework by efficiently managing HTTP requests and responses. It understands user requests and 
directs them to the appropriate service handlers, ensuring smooth communication between the user and 
the system. This layer carefully verifies the authenticity of incoming client requests, comparing them 
to established standards, before passing them on to the service layer, reducing the chances of errors. 
It bridges the client and service layer, improving communication and the system's efficiency.

<Callout type="INFO">
Serving as the application's frontline, the Routing Layer in an **Express.js** application equates to 
the Presentation Layer of traditional three-tier architectures. Here, **routes** and **middleware** deftly 
orchestrate the flow of HTTP requests and responses.
</Callout>

<Callout type="WARNING">
Dragging the Express `req` object beyond controllers can complicate potential framework switches and 
testing and tangle the app with Express specifics. A better practice is to extract only the necessary 
data from `req` and forward it. This way, the Express logic remains in the controllers where it belongs.
</Callout>

- **The Service Layer** is a vital part of your application, handling user requests from the routing 
layer. This layer manages and interprets each request, selecting the necessary service operations. It 
also coordinates with the Data Access Layer to fetch, modify, add, or remove data. Finally, the 
Service Layer prepares the data to be returned to the client through the Routing Layer.

- **The Data Access Layer** bridges your application and its underlying data storage, such as 
databases like **MongoDB**. It executes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations when equipped 
with repositories, queries, and data connections.

In the context of building a REST API using **Express.js**, the 3-layer architecture often makes more 
sense, and here's why:

- **Simplified Complexity:** The 3-tier architecture's inherent simplicity is a significant benefit 
when designing a REST API in Express.js, as it aligns seamlessly with the RESTful design principle of 
providing an uncomplicated interface for server-side resource management. This architecture simplifies 
the API design by minimizing unnecessary complexity and optimizes the path between client requests and 
server responses, making the overall system easier to comprehend, implement, and use.

- **Defined Responsibilities and Enhanced Maintainability:** In the 3-tier architecture, each layer, 
namely the Routing, Service, and Data Access Layers, have distinct responsibilities such as handling 
client requests, managing business rules, and directly interacting with the data source, respectively. 
This explicit separation of concerns significantly streamlines debugging and maintenance, as 
developers can modify one layer without inadvertently impacting others, thus enhancing the overall 
maintainability of the codebase.

- **Seamless Alignment with REST Principles:** The principles of RESTful design strongly advocate for 
stateless communication and resource representation. This philosophy links seamlessly with the 3-tier 
architecture. The model provides an explicit and efficient path from the HTTP request to the 
application's business logic and data storage. This alignment enhances the API's conformity with REST 
principles and elevates the overall quality of the REST API design.

- **Scalability:** Lastly, the 3-tier architecture does not restrict scalability. By isolating the 
business logic from data access and routing, developers can scale each application part independently 
if needed. This architectural flexibility is a significant advantage when dealing with the growth of 
the application and increased demand.

The 3-layer architecture in Express.js is an excellent choice for building a REST API. It separates 
concerns, making the codebase more modular, reusable, and scalable. This approach simplifies 
development and testing, making it a top choice for various applications.

## Dependency Management and Flow

<AdaptiveImage alt={'3-tier architecture - Dependency Flow'} src={'/img/blog/9/2.webp'} width={768} height={192} />

Managing dependencies is critical for maintaining a clean, testable, scalable codebase. In the 3-Tier 
Architecture, understanding how dependencies flow and interact across the Routing Layer (Presentation 
Layer in other contexts), Service Layer (Business Logic Layer), and Data Access Layer can be critical 
to developing efficient applications.

- **Routing Layer (Presentation Layer):** In a RESTful API, the routing layer directs incoming HTTP 
requests to the appropriate service handlers. Dependencies at this layer may include middleware 
functions for handling request and response objects and services from the Service Layer. Here, it is 
crucial to keep the dependencies minimal to maintain the layer's primary focus - routing and minor 
data formatting.
- **Service Layer (Business Logic Layer):** This layer manages the core application logic. It 
integrates validation tools, business rule modules, and data access objects. Proper dependency 
management here ensures clarity and ease of maintenance.
- **Data Access Layer:** This layer interacts directly with the database or other data sources. It 
will depend on modules and libraries related to database access, such as ORM libraries (like 
**Mongoose** or **Sequelize**), database drivers, and perhaps caching systems. This layer should not 
have upward dependencies to prevent tight coupling with business logic or routing concerns.

It is important to note that dependencies must align with the control flow, which means they should 
point inward. Precisely, dependencies must move from the **Routing Layer** to the **Service Layer** 
and then to the **Data Access Layer**. This rule, known as the **"Dependence Rule"**, is a fundamental 
principle of Clean Architecture. It guarantees that high-level policies like business rules are not 
dependent on low-level details like database access.

## Folder Structure in Express APIs

Organizing code well-structured and meaningfully is crucial for a software project's maintainability, 
scalability, and comprehensibility. Two prominent patterns in organizing code are **folder structure by 
Technical Role** and **folder structure by Business Component**. Let's dive into each.

### Based on Technical Role

In this approach, the codebase is organized based on its technical function within the application. 
Common directory names you might encounter include `controllers`, `models`, `routes`, `services`, and 
`dao`; Each directory group files based on their primary role.

```text
|-- api/
|   |-- controllers/
|   |   |-- project-controller.ts
|   |   |-- task-controller.ts
|   |-- dao/
|   |   |-- project-dao.ts
|   |   |-- task-dao.ts
|   |-- models/
|   |   |-- project-model.ts
|   |   |-- task-model.ts
|   |-- routes/
|   |   |-- project-routes.ts
|   |   |-- task-routes.ts
|   |-- services/
|   |   |-- project-service.ts
|   |   |-- task-service.ts
|-- app.ts
|-- index.ts
```

Structuring by technical role provides an intuitive and consistent layout, allowing developers to 
identify component roles quickly. Its predictability is further enhanced as many frameworks adopt or 
recommend this approach, easing the onboarding process for new team members.

However, its primary drawback is the potential obscurity of business context, making it challenging to 
relate parts to specific business functionalities. This structure can become cumbersome and hard to 
manage as the application expands. Developers familiar with traditional MVC might find it unfamiliar, 
and it demands a solid grasp of the application's business domains.

### Based on Business Component

In contrast, structuring by component groups code based on the specific business feature or domain it 
addresses. Here, directories might be named after the major features of your application, such as 
`project` and `task`. Each of these directories would then contain all technical roles related to that 
feature.

```text
|-- api/
|   |-- components/
|   |   |-- project/
|   |   |   |-- controller.ts
|   |   |   |-- dao.ts
|   |   |   |-- model.ts
|   |   |   |-- routes.ts
|   |   |   |-- service.ts
|   |   |-- task/
|   |   |   |-- controller.ts
|   |   |   |-- dao.ts
|   |   |   |-- model.ts
|   |   |   |-- routes.ts
|   |   |   |-- service.ts
|-- app.ts
|-- index.ts

```

Structuring by business domain aligns seamlessly with the application's business logic, offering 
clarity to all parties. This approach promotes scalability, introducing new components without 
overwhelming existing folders. Collaborative efforts benefit, as teams can work on distinct components 
without overlap. The design remains modular and decoupled, enhancing maintainability by minimizing 
unintended interdependencies. Additionally, developers find navigating and understanding specific 
features more intuitive.

On the downside, initiating this structure can be challenging, mainly if the business domain needs 
clarification. There's also a risk of inconsistent component structuring, which might disrupt the 
uniformity of the codebase.

Based on the information provided, what are the reasons for choosing to organize by **Business 
Components**? Here are some convincing factors:

- **Enhanced Modularity:** Breaking down the application by components ensures each module is 
self-contained with its responsibilities. This promotes better code isolation and easier debugging, as 
issues within a component can be addressed without interfering with other application parts.
- **Clear Business Context:** Structuring by component intuitively aligns with business 
functionalities. When developers need to work on a particular feature or functionality, everything 
related to that component - from routes to data access - is located in one place, reducing the time 
spent searching for related files.
- **Scalability:** As the application grows, adding new features or components becomes seamless. Each 
new component can be slotted into the existing structure without disrupting the established flow, 
ensuring the application remains maintainable even as its complexity increases.
- **Facilitated Collaboration:** When multiple developers work on different components, the risk of 
merge conflicts is reduced. Each developer can work within their designated component folder, making 
parallel development more manageable.
- **Testing Boundaries:** Components can be individually tested, making focusing on their unique 
business logic simpler during the testing phase.

**Technical Role** structuring provides function-based organization, whereas **Business Components** 
structure reflects business operations, enhancing scalability and maintainability. The choice depends 
on the project's nuances. However, the Business Components approach is often more beneficial for 
projects with distinct business components and modular expansion.

<Callout type="INFO">
If you're thinking about versioning your API, it's recommended that you create separate folders for 
each version, such as **"v1"**, **"v2"**, and so on, within your API directory. By organizing your 
existing API files into a **"v1"** folder, you can easily structure your API as `'api/v1'`, `
'api/v2'`, and so forth. This will guarantee backward compatibility across different versions.
</Callout>

## Practical Implementation

<Callout type="WARNING">
While the current implementation is a foundational prototype illustrating our discussion, it is not 
the final version. We will retain this base while enhancing it considerably as we delve into topics 
like **ORM**, **Dependency Injection**, **Error Handling**, **Middleware**, and more.
</Callout>

Within your **"src"** folder, create an **"api"** directory. This will house your application's 
primary components and associated elements like **middleware**. Under the **"api"** directory, create a 
**"components"** sub-directory. Each component of your application, for instance, **"task"**, will 
reside in its distinct directory.

The **"task"** directory will contain all the files related to our **task** component, such as **routes**, 
**services**, **data access objects (DAO)**, and **models**.

Start by defining your `Task` model in a **"model.ts"** file. This file describes the structure of a 
task, including properties such as `id`, `name`, `description`, and `status`. No dependencies are 
injected into this file as it merely defines the data structure.

```ts showLineNumbers title="src/api/components/task/model.ts"
type Task = {
	id: string;
	name: string;
	description: string;
	status: 'To Do' | 'In Progress' | 'Done';
};

export default Task;
```

<Callout type="WARNING">
Remember that in practical scenarios, you'd typically define your schema using an ORM like **Mongoose**. 
We'll talk about databases in a later article.
</Callout>

Next, create a **"dao.ts"** file. This file includes functions to interact with your data sources. 
In our example, we're using hard-coded tasks in an array. However, in a real-world application, you 
would replace these with functions that interact with your database (We'll do so when we introduce 
**MongoDB** and **Mongoose**). This file has only the `model` as its dependency, but you can also 
remove the model file and use it directly in the **"dao.ts"** file.

```ts showLineNumbers title="src/api/components/task/dao.ts"
import Task from './model';

const tasks: Task[] = [
	{
		id: 'task-001',
		name: 'Implement Authentication',
		description: 'Create the authentication module with JWT for user login.',
		status: 'In Progress'
	},
	{
		id: 'task-002',
		name: 'Design Database Schema',
		description: 'Design the database schema for the product catalog and user profiles.',
		status: 'To Do'
	},
	{
		id: 'task-003',
		name: 'Fix Navigation Bug',
		description: 'Resolve the navigation bug that occurs on mobile devices in landscape mode.',
		status: 'Done'
	}
];

const find = (): Task[] => {
	return tasks;
};

const findById = (id: string): Task | undefined => {
	return tasks.find((task) => task.id === id);
};

const findByStatus = (status: 'To Do' | 'In Progress' | 'Done'): Task[] => {
	return tasks.filter((task) => task.status === status);
};

export { find, findById, findByStatus };
```

The **"service.ts"** file interacts with the **DAO** to manipulate the data. Here, the `DAO` is 
used as a dependency so that the service layer interacts with it to perform necessary operations. 
The service layer may contain additional processing logic before forwarding the data to the controller.

```ts showLineNumbers title="src/api/components/task/service.ts"
import * as dao from './dao';

const getTasks = () => {
	return dao.find();
};

const getTaskById = (id: string) => {
	return dao.findById(id);
};

const getTasksByStatus = (status: 'To Do' | 'In Progress' | 'Done') => {
	return dao.findByStatus(status);
};

export { getTasks, getTaskById, getTasksByStatus };
```

The **"controller.ts"** file communicates with the service layer to retrieve or modify data. The 
outcomes are then conveyed to the client. The `service` is included in this file as a dependency on 
the controller. The controller offers functions that manage different tasks, such as retrieving all 
tasks or a specific task by its id.

```ts showLineNumbers title="src/api/components/task/controller.ts"
import * as service from './service';

const getTasks = () => {
	const tasks = service.getTasks();
	return tasks;
};

const getTask = (id: string | undefined) => {
	if (!id) {
		// you can do whatever process you like, ex: throw an error
		return;
	}
	const task = service.getTaskById(id!);
	return task;
};

const getTasksByStatus = (status: string) => {
	if (!status || !['To Do', 'In Progress', 'Done'].includes(status)) {
		// you can do whatever process you like, ex: throw an error
		return;
	}
	const tasks = service.getTasksByStatus(status as 'To Do' | 'In Progress' | 'Done');
	return tasks;
};

export { getTasks, getTask, getTasksByStatus };
```

The **"routes.ts"** file handles HTTP requests and directs them to the appropriate **controller** 
functions. The file exports an array of `route` objects containing a `path`, `method`, and `handler`. 
In this file, the `controller` is used as a dependency to route handlers.

```ts showLineNumbers title="src/api/components/task/routes.ts"
import { Request, Response } from 'express';
import * as controller from './controller';

const routes = [
	{
		path: '/tasks',
		method: 'get',
		handler: (req: Request, res: Response) => {
			const data = controller.getTasks();
			res.status(200).json(data);
		}
	},
	{
		path: '/tasks/:id',
		method: 'get',
		handler: (req: Request, res: Response) => {
			const { id } = req.params;
			const data = controller.getTask(id);
			res.status(200).json(data);
		}
	},
	{
		path: '/tasks/status/:status',
		method: 'get',
		handler: (req: Request, res: Response) => {
			const { status } = req.params;
			const data = controller.getTasksByStatus(status!);
			res.status(200).json(data);
		}
	}
];

export default routes;
```

Now that we created our files, we still need to plug the routes into the express Router to access them. 
As of now, attempting to navigate to **http://localhost:4000/api/tasks** would greet you with a 
**"Cannot GET /api/tasks"** alert since our Express server doesn't know about these routes yet.

A conventional solution is manually importing the `Router` from `Express` and registering our routes in 
the **routes.ts** file. Here's a simplified example of how you could do this:

```ts
import { Router } from 'express';
import controller from './controller';

const router = Router();

router.get('/tasks', controller.getTasks);
...
...

export default router;
```

You can then bring in this `Router` and integrate it with your Express app as follows:

```ts
app.use('/api', tasksRouter);
```

Now, imagine that you have multiple components, each with a handful of routes. It would become tedious 
to register each route manually. This is where dynamic route loading can be very helpful.

To streamline the organization of your component, create an **index.ts** file inside the **task** 
folder; this file serves as the entry point for your component. This is where other related parts of 
the task routing, such as middleware, could be exported. For the current implementation, focus will 
be placed on exporting the routes.

```ts showLineNumbers title="src/api/components/task/index.ts"
import routes from './routes';

export default routes;
```

Before we start with the process of routes loading, I want to shift to a more organized server 
structure. As your application expands, the once-simple **app.ts** file can become cluttered. To 
maintain clarity, consider introducing a **providers** folder. This structure separates 
configurations, making the server more modular and easier to manage.

The **providers** folder typically includes foundational parts of your application, which aren't 
necessarily tied to any specific feature but are essential for the functioning of your app. This can 
include services like **database connections**, **authentication providers**, **third-party 
integrations**, etc.

Within the **providers** folder, create a **server** sub-folder to house the specific logic related to 
your Express.js server. The server folder can include configuration for your express application, 
middleware registration, error handling, route registration, and even the code to start the server.

```text
src/
├── api/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── task/
├── providers/
│   ├── server/
│   │   ├── index.ts
│   │   ├── components.ts
│   │   └── helper.ts
└── index.ts
```

Create a **components.ts** file within the server folder. This file is a registry for all the 
application's components, such as `task`.

```ts showLineNumbers title="src/providers/server/components.ts"
export type Component = string | NestedComponents;

export interface NestedComponents {
	[key: string]: Component;
}

const components: NestedComponents = {
	task: 'task',
	/* for nested components
	users: {
		roles: 'roles',
		auth: 'auth'
	}*/
};

export default components;
```

In this setup, a `Component` can be a `string` that identifies the name of a folder or a 
`NestedComponents` object for nested Components. The `NestedComponents` interface maps folder names to 
corresponding Component values, accommodating basic and complex structures. This design makes it 
effortless to integrate new components into dynamic routing.

Let's create a **"helper.ts"** file containing utility functions that help dynamically load your 
components and register their routes with an Express `Router`.

```ts showLineNumbers title="src/providers/server/helper.ts"
import { Request, Response, Router } from 'express';
import { NestedComponents } from './components';

type HttpMethod = 'get' | 'post' | 'put' | 'delete' | 'patch';
export type Module = { default: Route[] };

interface Route {
	path: string;
	method: HttpMethod;
	handler: (req: Request, res: Response) => void;
}

const validMethods: HttpMethod[] = ['get', 'post', 'put', 'delete', 'patch'];

const getPaths = (components: NestedComponents, parentKey = ''): string[] => {
	return Object.keys(components).reduce((acc, key) => {
		const fullPath = parentKey ? `${parentKey}/${key}` : key;
		const value = components[key];
		if (typeof value === 'object' && value) {
			acc.push(...getPaths(value, fullPath));
		} else {
			acc.push(fullPath);
		}
		return acc;
	}, [] as string[]);
};

const registerRoutes = (router: Router, module: Module) => {
	if (!Array.isArray(module.default)) {
		throw new Error(`Invalid module`);
	}
	const routes = module.default;
	for (const route of routes) {
		const method = route.method.toLowerCase() as HttpMethod;
		if (validMethods.includes(method)) {
			router[method](route.path, route.handler);
		} else {
			throw new Error(`Invalid method: ${method}`);
		}
	}
};

export { getPaths, registerRoutes };
```

Here, `HttpMethod` refers to a category that includes all acceptable HTTP methods. Meanwhile, `Route` 
is an interface that defines a route's format, including its `path`, HTTP `method`, and `handler` function.
The `module`is a type that represents the structure of an imported component module. It expects the 
module to export an array of Route objects as its default export.

`getPaths` is a recursive function that takes a `NestedComponents` object and builds an array of 
paths to all components, considering nested component structures.

`registerRoutes`takes an Express `Router`** `and a `Module` and registers all of the module's routes 
with the `Router`.

Finally, create **"index.ts"** file, the entry point for starting your server. It imports your 
components and helper functions, then uses them to dynamically load your components, register their 
routes, and start your Express server.

```ts showLineNumbers title="src/providers/server/index.ts"
import express, { Router } from 'express';
import { Module, getPaths, registerRoutes } from './helper';
import components from './components';

const COMPONENTS_DIRECTORY = '../../api/components';
const BASE_API_PATH = '/api';
const PORT = 4000;

const start = async () => {
	const app = express();
	const router = Router();
	const componentsPath = getPaths(components);
	try {
		const modulePromises: Promise<Module>[] = componentsPath?.map(
			(path) => import(`${COMPONENTS_DIRECTORY}/${path}`)
		);
		const modulesList = await Promise.all(modulePromises);
		for (const module of modulesList || []) {
			try {
				registerRoutes(router, module);
			} catch (error) {
				if (error instanceof Error) {
					// eslint-disable-next-line no-console
					console.log(error.message);
				}
			}
		}
	} catch (error) {
		if (error instanceof Error) {
			// eslint-disable-next-line no-console
			console.log(error.message);
		}
	}

	app.use(BASE_API_PATH, router);
	app.listen(PORT, () => {
		// eslint-disable-next-line no-console
		console.info('Server running on port 4000...');
	});
};

export { start };
```

<Callout type="WARNING">
I'm using the `// eslint-disable-next-line no-console` comment to silence the ESLint rule; later, we 
will introduce a **logger** to be used instead of the `console`.
</Callout>

Since the start function has become asynchronous, update the `index.ts` in the `src` folder to `await` 
the server initialization.

```ts showLineNumbers title="src/providers/server/index.ts"
import * as server from './providers/server';

(async () => {
	await server.start();
})();
```

<Callout type="INFO">
We're utilizing an **Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)** to enable `await` at the top 
level in **index.ts**. This pattern allows asynchronous code to run in a context where `await` is 
valid without moving everything inside a function.
</Callout>

To verify our API's functionality, access the endpoint that retrieves all tasks. Navigate to 
**http://localhost:4000/api/tasks** in your browser or use your preferred API development platform.

## Conclusion
The 3-tier architecture with a component-based folder setup in Express.js helps build a tidy and 
easy-to-manage REST API. Splitting the app into transparent layers and organizing them by business 
parts makes it reflect real-world needs and makes adding new stuff easier. Express gives a lot of 
freedom, and by adding this structured approach, we dodge potential messes and end up with a neat, 
expandable app. It's a handy roadmap for building something new or refactoring an old project.
