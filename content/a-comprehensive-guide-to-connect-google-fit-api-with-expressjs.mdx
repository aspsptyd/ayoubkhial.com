Health and fitness are increasingly connected with technology in today's digital world. [Google Fit API](https://developers.google.com/fit) is an excellent platform for developers who want to make health-conscious apps. It's easy to take advantage of health and wellness data from different devices and apps and combine them. But How The Google Fit API works, and how do you use Google Fit API in a Node.js app with the Express framework? In this article, we'll see how to do it step by step, covering setup, authentication, and a few use cases.

## What is Google Fit API?
So, what is Google Fit API? It's a set of rules letting your app talk to Google Fit. It provides tools to read, write, and sync health data like steps, heart rate, etc. It's great for building fitness and health-related apps that give you a complete view of your health journey.
There are many use cases for using Goole Fit API. For example:
- **Fitness Tracking Apps:** allow individuals to measure and record their physical activities such as walking, running, or cycling. These apps help users monitor and keep track of their fitness progress and goals.
- **Health Monitoring Apps:** collect data from devices like heart rate monitors or blood pressure machines. This can be really helpful for people with chronic conditions. 
- **Nutrition Apps:** collect data on dietary habits, calorie intake, and hydration levels. Combining this data with exercise metrics can create a well-rounded health profile.

## Google Fit Components
<Image alt={'Google Fit API Components'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/1.webp'} width={768} height={340} priority={true} />

It's essential to know the different parts of Google Fit to use it well. Google Fit is like a one-stop shop for keeping track of your health and wellness. It has a lot of different parts that work together to help you keep on top of things. Let's take a closer look at what's inside.

### The Fitness Store
The Fitness Store is the core repository in Google Fit, where all user health and wellness data gets stored. It is a centralized cloud-based service that receives data from various sourcesâ€”wearables like fitness trackers, smartwatches, or other fitness apps.

For developers, the Fitness Store serves as a secure and comprehensive database. You can read from or write to this store when creating health and wellness applications. This enables your Node.js application to tap into various health metrics, from step counts to heart rates.

### The sensor Framework
Google Fit offers a sensor framework to facilitate easy interaction with the fitness store. This framework provides high-level representations or abstractions that allow you to work with the data stored in the fitness store. Developers can smoothly fetch, manipulate, or update health data by employing these abstractions via Google Fit APIs.

Google Fit offers various types of sensors for diverse data categories, such as:
- Physical activity (steps, running, cycling)
- Biometric data (heart rate, blood pressure)
- Nutrition and hydration
- Sleep and stress metrics

Each category can have one or more associated sensors, allowing your application to interact with various data points.

### Permissions and User Controls
User consent is a cornerstone of Google Fit. You must secure their explicit permission to access an individual's health and wellness data. Google Fit accomplishes this through a defined set of authorization scopes. These scopes delineate the extent of data your application can access, ensuring a transparent and secure user experience.

Google APIs commonly use [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) for authentication and authorization. The process begins with your application directing the user to Google's OAuth consent screen. Here, the user can review which data types the application requests access to and decide whether to grant those permissions.

During the OAuth 2.0 setup, you must specify the scopes your application requires. Scopes define the extent of access that your application will have. For instance, Google Fit API has different scopes for reading fitness activities, sleep data, or nutrition information. Choose scopes carefully based on your application's needs.

[Read more about Google Authorization using OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2).

### Google Fit APIs
Last but not least are the Google Fit APIs, available for Android and REST APIs. These APIs serve as the communication bridge between your application and the Google Fit ecosystem. They allow for the creation of cross-platform applications, supporting various devices and platforms, including Android, iOS, and web apps.

After a comprehensive exploration of the Google Fit components, it's crucial to understand how these elements integrate within the broader Google ecosystem.

## Google API Console
[Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) is your personal control room for managing Google Cloud APIs. It's a dashboard where you can create new projects, activate APIs, track usage, and set up credentials. It's the place to go if you want to interact with all of Google's awesome services.

### Create a New Project
A **project** is a unit in Google Cloud for organizing resources, managing IAM, and using APIs. It keeps resources and configurations separate, preventing actions in one project from affecting another. Each project has a unique ID and name linked to a billing account. The Google Cloud Console provides a consolidated view of a project's resources, expenses, and performance metrics for easy administration and oversight.

To create a new project, navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/); you'll see a project dropdown at the top of the page. Click on it and select **"New Project"** from the dialog box.

<Image alt={'Google API Project List'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/2.webp'} width={768} height={477} />

Fill in the project details, ensuring you provide a descriptive name, such as **"Fitness APP - Nodejs"**, to capture its intent. Additionally, you can specify its organizational location by selecting the appropriate parent folder or organization, though this step is optional.

<Image alt={'Google API Project Create Page'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/3.webp'} width={768} height={450} />

<Callout>
By default, the Project ID is generated using your project name with a hyphen and sometimes some random number. It can be edited by clicking **"Edit"** before creating your project because it can't be changed later.
</Callout>

Google Cloud will now initialize your project. This might take a few moments.

### Enable Fitness API
Activating an API allows your project to tap into specific features. For the Google Fit API, this translates to harnessing its diverse fitness data functionalities. When this API is enabled, your project can interact with its features, invoking its methods and extracting relevant data.

To enable the fit API, head to the [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/) and input **"Fitness API"** in the search bar. Once located, click on enable. Or you can directly navigate to [this link](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=fitness), which will directly take you to the enabling flow.

Ensure your desired project is selected in the console. Validate your selection by pressing **"Next"**; Then click on **"Enable"**.

<Image alt={'Google Console - Enable Fitness API'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/4.webp'} width={768} height={394} />

Upon successful activation, the **"Enable"** option becomes inactive, signaling that your project now has access to the Google Fit API.

### Configure the OAuth Consent Screen
After enabling the Google Fit API for your project, configuring the [OAuth Consent Screen](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent) is the next step. This screen is a permissions gateway, mediating access between your app and the user's health data. It's a critical element of the OAuth 2.0 framework, which lets users grant third-party apps access to their data without disclosing their passwords.

To configure the OAuth consent screen, Click on the menu icon at the top left of your Google API Console. Then, navigate to **"APIs & Services"** and select **"OAuth Consent Screen"**.

<Image alt={'Google Console - OAuth Consent Screen Configuration'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/5.webp'} width={768} height={462} />

You'll be prompted to choose between two user types:
- **External:** For applications that intend to access users' data outside your organization.
- **Internal:** Restricted to users within your Google Workspace domain.
Make a selection based on your application's target audience. I will opt for **"External"** for this tutorial since we're still in testing mode.

<Image alt={'Google Console - Create OAuth Consent Screen'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/6.webp'} width={768} height={436} />

Next, Fill Out the App Information:
- **App Name:** The name will be displayed to users during authorization.
- **User Support Email:** An email address where users can get support or ask questions about the app.
- **App Logo** (optional): You can upload a logo that users will see on the consent screen.

<Image alt={'Google Console - OAuth Consent Screen Information'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/7.webp'} width={768} height={517} />

You can also add URLs under **"App Domain"** to your app's main pages, like privacy policy or terms of service; while this is optional, **"Authorized Domains"** are mandatory. However, we can set them later through credentials settings.

Finally, make sure to provide at least one contact email. You can include more if you wish.

<Image alt={'Google Console - OAuth Consent Screen Information'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/8.webp'} width={768} height={437} />

Upon clicking **"Continue"**, you'll move on to define the scopes or permissions your app will request.

Scopes determine the type of access your application requests from users. While some default scopes may be pre-selected, ensure you only choose the ones necessary for your application to function. Over-requesting can discourage users from granting consent.

<Image alt={'Google Console - OAuth Consent Screen Scopes'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/9.webp'} width={768} height={374} />

I will search for fitness in the scope list and select all.

<Image alt={'Google Console - OAuth Consent Screen Scope List'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/10.webp'} width={768} height={383} />

Finally, if you selected the **"External"** user type, you'd need to add test users. Only these specified users can grant consent during the testing phase.

<Image alt={'Google Console - OAuth Consent Screen Test Users'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/11.webp'} width={768} height={456} />

### Credentials
Credentials play a pivotal role in the Google API ecosystem. They serve as the digital handshake between your application and Google's services.

To set up credentials, Begin by clicking **"Credentials"** on the left menu within the Google API Console. Then click **"Create Credentials"** button at the top of the page and choose **"OAuth client ID"** from the dropdown.

<Image alt={'Google Console - Set up Credentials'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/12.webp'} width={768} height={430} />

You will be prompted to designate the type of application you are developing, and your options will include:
- **Web application:** For apps that run on a server and are accessed through web browsers.
- **Android: Specifically:** for applications developed for Android operating systems.
- **Chrome Extension:** For browser extensions that run on Google Chrome.
- **IOS:** Suited for applications designed to operate on Apple's iOS platform.
- **TVs and Limited Input Devices:** Intended for smart TVs or other devices that lack web browsing capabilities.
- **Universal Windows Platform (UWP):** Ideal for applications that function across multiple platforms, including Windows 10 and Xbox.

I will select **"Web application"** since we aim to connect to the API through the express server.

<Image alt={'Google Console - Create OAuth Client ID'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/13.webp'} width={768} height={329} />

While the **"Authorized JavaScript origins"** section isn't mandatory for web server applications, you must provide the **"Authorized redirect URIs"**. For example, if you're using an Express server on port `8000`, you might create a route like `GET:/get-token`.

<Image alt={'Google Console - Create OAuth Client ID'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/14.webp'} width={768} height={354} />

After providing the necessary details, click the **"Create"** button. Once done, you'll receive your OAuth 2.0 credentials, which include:
- **Client ID:** A unique string representing the registration information.
- **Client Secret:** A secret token your application uses to exchange for an access token.

<Image alt={'Google Console - Credentials Detail'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/15.webp'} width={768} height={610} />

Securely store these credentials, especially the Client Secret, as they'll be essential for authenticating your application with Google services.

<Callout type="WARNING">
While I'm revealing the secrets of my project for demonstration purposes, you should never share your secrets publicly. Such actions can compromise your project's security. 
</Callout>

## Integrating Google API with Express.js
Start by opening your terminal and navigating to the directory where you want your project to reside. Then, initialize a new Node.js project and install Express.js by running the following commands:

```bash
npm init -y
npm i express
```
In the root folder of your project, create an `index.js` file, which will serve as the main entry point. Then, generate a `.env` file to securely store sensitive information like API keys and other environment variables.

Fill the `.env` file with your Google Fit API credentials and other relevant variables:

```text title=".env"
NODE_PORT=8000
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=768678181545-7ltedqlg2jngn952olth7bju4pvc446t.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=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
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/get-token
GOOGLE_SCOPE=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/fitness.activity.read
```

Update your `package.json` file to include a start script that runs your Node app, watches for changes, and automatically loads environment variables from the `.env` file.

```json {6} title="package.json"
{
	"name": "fitness-app",
	"main": "index.js",
	"type": "module",
	"scripts": {
		"start": "node --env-file=.env --watch index.js"
	},
	"dependencies": {
		"express": "^4.18.2"
	}
}
```

<Callout>
As of version `18.11.0`, Node.js offers a [built-in watch mode](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v18.11.0#watch-mode-experimental), and starting with version `20.6.0`, [native support for .env files is available](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.6.0#built-in-env-file-support). These features eliminate the need for third-party packages like `dotenv` and `nodemon`.
</Callout>

With all the initial setup done, it's time to create a simple Express server. Open your `index.js` file and add the following code:

```js title="index.js"
import express from 'express';

const PORT = process.env.NODE_PORT;
const app = express();

app.listen(PORT, () => {
	console.log(`App listening at ${PORT}`);
});
```

Lastly, run the start script to ensure everything is set up correctly. You should see a log message confirming that your server is running:

```bash
npm start
# App listening at 8000
```

### Connecting to Google Project
To interact with Google Fit API or any other Google API, Google provides a Node.js client library called [googleapis](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-nodejs-client). This library offers an easy and efficient way to work with a host of Google APIs, including but not limited to Google Drive, Google Sheets, and Google Calendar.

To see all available APIs, visit the [Google APIs Explorer](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer). It provides detailed documentation, guidelines, and sample requests to help you understand each API's capabilities.

```bash
npm i googleapis
```

<Callout>
If you want to minimize startup times and use only the Google Fit API, consider installing the fitness submodule as an independent dependency (`npm i @googleapis/fitness`).
</Callout>

Google APIs often require secure authentication. The googleapis library supports multiple authentication strategies, including API keys and OAuth 2.0.

Since we're using OAuth 2.0 for this project, you must create a new `OAuth2` client instance. This instance is critical in generating URLs for user consent and exchanging authorization codes for access tokens.

In the `index.js` file, import the Google API library and initialize the `OAuth2` client:

```js {2,7-11} title="index.js"
import express from 'express';
import { google } from 'googleapis';

const PORT = process.env.NODE_PORT;
const app = express();

const oAuth2Client = new google.auth.OAuth2(
	process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
	process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
	process.env.GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI
);

app.listen(PORT, () => {
	console.log(`App listening at ${PORT}`);
});
```

The `OAuth2` constructor requires three key arguments:
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Obtained from the Google Developers Console, this ID uniquely identifies your app to Google's OAuth 2.0 server.
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Also obtained from the Google Developers Console, this secret acts similarly to a password. Your application will use it when requesting access tokens.
- `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`: This URL is where Google will redirect users after they either grant or deny permission to your application. This URI should match one of the URIs you've registered in the Google Developers Console. It's an essential part of the OAuth 2.0 process, especially when exchanging authorization codes for access tokens.

### Requst Access Token From Google API
After initializing the `OAuth2` client, the first step is to navigate users to a consent screen provided by Google. This screen is instrumental in obtaining the user's approval to access specified Google services on their behalf.

We will use the `generateAuthUrl` method of the `oAuth2Client` instance we created to facilitate this. This method will generate the URL for Google's OAuth2 consent screen. This logic will reside in a dedicated route within our Express application for better organization.

```js {6-12}
import express from 'express';
import { google } from 'googleapis';

// ...existing code

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
	const url = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({
		access_type: 'offline',
		scope: process.env.GOOGLE_SCOPE
	});
	res.json({ url });
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
	console.log(`App listening at ${PORT}`);
});
```

The `generateAuthUrl` method generates the consent screen URL using the parameters you provide. Specifically, it takes an object with the following properties:
- `access_type`: This is the type of access your application requests from the user. When set to `'offline'`, your application will receive a refresh and initial access token. The refresh token is valuable because it allows your application to request new access tokens without requiring the user to re-grant permissions, ensuring uninterrupted access to the user's Google services.
- `scope`: This defines the permissions your app is seeking concerning Google's services. It specifies which Google service's data you aim to access. The scope value is generally a URL or URI that Google provides for each service, like Google Drive or Google Fit, that your app needs to access. In our example,I'm using the scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/fitness.activity.read`, which gives permission to see and store the physical activity data.

<Callout>
You can find the list of scopes specific to the Fitness API in the [Google Identity Platform documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#fitness) and for all other Google APIs.
</Callout>

When you access this endpoint, it generates a redirect URL. This URL is the gateway for initiating the authentication and authorization process with Google.

<Image alt={'Google API - Auth URL'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/16.webp'} width={768} height={386} />

Before navigating the OAuth URL, setting up the redirect routes for your application is required. Recall that we configured a redirection URL in the Google Console as `http://localhost:8000/get-token`. Let's now set a GET route at this endpoint.

```js {3,7-15}
import express from 'express';
import { google } from 'googleapis';
import url from 'url';

// ...existing code

app.get('/get-token', async (req, res, next) => {
	try {
		const { code } = url.parse(req.url, true).query;
		const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);
		res.json({ token: tokens.access_token });
	} catch (error) {
		next(error);
	}
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
	console.log(`App listening at ${PORT}`);
});
```

A query parameter named `code` is included upon Google's redirection to the `/get-token` endpoint. We extract this code using Node.js' built-in `url` module to parse the request URL. Then, the `getToken` method of the `oAuth2Client` exchanges this authorization code for an access token. The returned object would contain the access token and possibly a refresh token if the `access_type` was previously set to `'offline'`.

To initiate Google's OAuth 2.0 process, visit the URL generated from the initial `GET:/ request`. You'll see a consent screen displaying your application's name and the Google accounts you are logged into. Select the account you wish to connect with to acquire the token.

<Callout>
If you still need to be signed into your Google account, the URL will initiate a sign-in process before proceeding.
</Callout>

<Image alt={'Google API Consent Screen - Sign in'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/17.webp'} width={768} height={548} />

<Callout type="WARNING">
Be aware that only accounts designated as test users in your Google Developer Console will be able to connect to the application. Unauthorized accounts will encounter an access restriction. Make sure to configure this setting before initiating the OAuth process.
</Callout>

After selecting your account, a warning will appear because the app is in testing mode and has not received verification. Just click on **"Continue"**.

<Image alt={'Google API Consent Screen - Unverified App'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/18.webp'} width={768} height={548} />

On the following screen, users are presented with a choice to either grant or deny the requested permissions.

<Image alt={'Google API Consent Screen - Grant/Deny Permissions'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/19.webp'} width={768} height={620} />

When a user **grants permission**, Google will direct the user to the URI specified in the `redirect_uri` parameter. In the example given, the URI is `http://localhost:8000/get-token`. Crucially, Google will add an authorization `code` parameter to this redirect URI. On the other hand, if the user **denies permission**, Google will still redirect to the specified `redirect_uri`. However, instead of an authorization code, it will append an error parameter to indicate that the user has been denied access.

If the permission is granted, The Google OAuth returns the token. You can also see the code parameter we used to generate the token in the address bar.

<Image alt={'Google API Consent Screen - Successful Redirection'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/20.webp'} width={768} height={382} />

Once you have successfully obtained the access token, you are prepared to fetch data from the Google Fitness API. This token is a key to unlock specific scopes or data points your application can access.

### Use Case: Fetch User Step Count Data

A good idea is to create a middleware function in your Express.js application. This middleware will run ahead of any routes that require secure access. It retrieves the token from the request header and attaches it to the `req` object, making it accessible throughout the subsequent route handlers.

```js {7-14}
import express from 'express';
import { google } from 'googleapis';
import url from 'url';

// ...existing code

app.use((req, res, next) => {
	const token = req.headers?.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
	if (!token) {
		return next(new Error('Please provide a token to access this resource'));
	}
	req.token = token;
	next();
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
	console.log(`App listening at ${PORT}`);
});
```

Let's create a new route to retrieve step count data to validate that our API workflow functions as expected. This will be a concrete test to ensure that our token-based authentication and data retrieval processes work smoothly.

```js {7-27}
import express from 'express';
import { google } from 'googleapis';
import url from 'url';

// ...existing code

app.get('/steps', async (req, res, next) => {
	try {
		oAuth2Client.setCredentials({ access_token: req.token });
		const fitnessStore = google.fitness({ version: 'v1', auth: oAuth2Client });
		const dataTypeName = 'com.google.step_count.delta';
		const dataSourceId = 'derived:com.google.step_count.delta:com.google.android.gms:estimated_steps';
		const data = {
			aggregateBy: [{ dataTypeName, dataSourceId }],
			bucketByTime: { durationMillis: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 },
			startTimeMillis: Date.now() - 20 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
			endTimeMillis: Date.now()
		};
		const result = await fitnessStore.users.dataset.aggregate({
			userId: 'me',
			requestBody: data
		});
		res.json(result);
	} catch (error) {
		next(error);
	}
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
	console.log(`App listening at ${PORT}`);
});
```

Let's take this route apart and see what we're dealing with:

First, the `setCredentials` method assigns the obtained access token to `oAuth2Client`. Any subsequent API interactions using this client will automatically use this token for verification.

```js
oAuth2Client.setCredentials({ access_token: token });
```

Using the `fitnessStore`, we instantiate Google's Fitness API client and authorize it with the `oAuth2Client`, designating its version as `'v1'`.

```js
const fitnessStore = google.fitness({ version: 'v1', auth: oAuth2Client });
```

We're all set to make API calls using the `fitnessStore`. For instance, if we want to fetch the user's step count for the previous three days and group it by day, we can send a specific `aggregation` object in the request body.

The aggregation object consists of the following parameters:
- `aggregateBy`: This parameter defines the type of data you want to collect. Here, the `dataTypeName` specifies that we're interested in step count deltas, representing changes in the step count. The `dataSourceId` narrows it to estimated steps collected by Google's Android services. (Read more about [Data Types](https://developers.google.com/fit/datatypes) and [Data Sources](https://developers.google.com/fit/rest/v1/reference/users/dataSources))
- `bucketByTime`: This parameter segments the data into time buckets, measured in milliseconds. In this example, each bucket represents 24 hours.
- `startTimeMillis`: This marks the beginning of the data collection time range; this example is set to three days from the current time.
- `endTimeMillis`: This marks the end of the time range for data collection.

Finally, we execute the aggregate method to pull the required data for the authenticated user, represented as `'me'`.

```js
const dataTypeName = 'com.google.step_count.delta';
const dataSourceId = 'derived:com.google.step_count.delta:com.google.android.gms:estimated_steps';
const body = {
	aggregateBy: [{ dataTypeName, dataSourceId }],
	bucketByTime: { durationMillis: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 },
	startTimeMillis: Date.now() - 3 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
	endTimeMillis: Date.now()
};
const result = await fitnessStore.users.dataset.aggregate({
	userId: 'me',
	requestBody: body
});
```

<Callout>
You can also use sessions to fetch data from the Google Fit API. Sessions are a convenient way to group datasets collected during specific activities like walks, runs, or sleep. To understand how to utilize sessions in your Google Fit API calls, consult the [Google Fit API Docs](https://developers.google.com/fit/sessions).
</Callout>

To test the `/steps` route, make a GET request and include the Google-issued token in the Authorization header. Use the format `"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"` to ensure proper authentication. Without this token, you won't be able to access the step count data.

<Image alt={'Get steps count aggregation - Google Fit API'} filename={'a-comprehensive-guide-to-connect-google-fit-api-with-expressjs/21.webp'} width={768} height={340} />

Let's examine each field in detail:

The `config` field outlines how the API request was configured. It consists of the following sub-fields:

```json
{
	"url": "Target endpoint for the request",
	"method": "HTTP method employed (e.g., POST)",
    "userAgentDirectives": "Software initiating the request",
    "data": "Request body detailing desired data, including aggregation parameters and time range",
	"headers": "Supplementary info like content type, authentication, and user agent",
    "responseType": "Defines the data parsing method for the response"
}
```

The `data` field is the core component containing the actual fitness data. It has only one sub-field, which holds each entry (day) data in an array composed of the following fields.

```json
{
	"startTimeMillis": "Starting timestamp for each bucket",
	"endTimeMillis": "Ending timestamp for each bucket",
	"dataset": [{ // Array of detailed data points within the timeframe
		"dataSourceId": "Source identifier for aggregated data",
		"points": [{ // List of raw data entries
			"startTimeNanos": "Exact starting timestamp for each data point",
            "endTimeNanos": "Exact ending timestamp for each data point",
			"dataTypeName": "Type of data, e.g., step count delta",
			"originDataSourceId": "Initial data source pre-aggregation",
			"value": [{
				"intVal": "Actual data point value, with 'intVal' representing step count"
			}]
		}]
	}]
}
```

The `header` field provides meta-information about the API response.
- Fields like `content-type`, `date`, and `server` describe the content and its origin.
- Security headers such as `x-content-type-options`, `x-frame-options`, and `x-xss-protection` reflect the server's security measures.

The `request` field holds particulars about the initiating request, while status and `statusText` specify the response status, with a code of `200` indicating success.

### Alternative Approach For Data Fetching
While the previous section uses Google's Node.js client library to fetch step count data, it's worth noting that you can achieve the same results with a more direct approach. This method directly interacts with the Google Fit API using standard HTTP requests, offering flexibility that might be desirable in certain situations.

In this alternative approach, you manually compose an HTTP `POST` request, set the necessary headers like `Authorization` and `Content-Type`, and send the request to Google Fit's API endpoint. JavaScript's native `fetch` function can be used to handle these HTTP operations.


```js {17-26}
import express from 'express';
import { google } from 'googleapis';
import url from 'url';

// ...existing code

app.get('/steps2', async (req, res, next) => {
	try {
		const dataTypeName = 'com.google.step_count.delta';
		const dataSourceId = 'derived:com.google.step_count.delta:com.google.android.gms:estimated_steps';
		const data = {
			aggregateBy: [{ dataTypeName, dataSourceId }],
			bucketByTime: { durationMillis: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 },
			startTimeMillis: Date.now() - 20 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
			endTimeMillis: Date.now()
		};
		const endpoint = 'https://www.googleapis.com/fitness/v1/users/me/dataset:aggregate';
		const response = await fetch(endpoint, {
			method: 'POST',
			headers: {
				Authorization: `Bearer ${req.token}`,
				'Content-Type': 'application/json',
			},
			body: JSON.stringify(data)
		});
		const result = await response.json();
		res.json(result);
	} catch (error) {
		next(error);
	}
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
	console.log(`App listening at ${PORT}`);
});
```

This method can be particularly useful if you wish to have more control over the API request and response handling. It also makes the code less dependent on any specific client library, which could be beneficial for various reasons, such as simplifying dependencies or meeting unique project requirements.

The direct API approach returns only the `bucket` field containing the requested data. In contrast, as in the first approach, using Google's Node.js client library yields a more comprehensive response that includes additional metadata.

### Performance Improvement with Partial Responses
Working with APIs often involves dealing with voluminous data, much of which you may not need. Google Fit Store offers a solution to this issue with its feature of **partial responses**. By incorporating the `fields` parameter in your API request, you can selectively filter the data you receive, enhancing performance and readability.

Here's an example using Google's Node.js client library:

```js {4}
const result = await fitnessStore.users.dataset.aggregate({
	userId: 'me',
	requestBody: body,
	fields: 'bucket(dataset(point(value(intVal))))'
});
```

The field selection is a string that uses a specific syntax to specify the `fields` to include in the response. In this case, the field selection consists of the `bucket`, `dataset`, `point`, and `value` fields, as well as the `intVal` property of the value field. Doing so limits the amount of data returned, making the response quicker and easier to handle.

If you are using the direct HTTP request approach described in the previous section, you can also add the `fields` query parameter to the endpoint URL like so:

```js {4}
const endpoint = 'https://www.googleapis.com/fitness/v1/users/me/dataset:aggregate?fields=bucket(dataset(point(value(intVal))))';
```

By integrating this technique, you achieve the following benefits:
- **Reduced Response Time:** Filtering data at the API level minimizes the data transmitted, making the response quicker.
- **Enhanced Data Management:** Only fetching the fields you need simplifies the task of parsing and manipulating the API response.
- **Resource Optimization:** A lighter payload reduces memory and bandwidth consumption, improving overall system performance.
