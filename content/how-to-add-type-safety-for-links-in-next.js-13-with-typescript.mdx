If you're like me, a Typescript fanatic, you always want to take advantage of all the cool things it
can do to improve your code and make it easier to maintain. After all, that's what most developers
are striving for.

Until recently, Next.js did not provide a built-in mechanism for ensuring type safety in its routing
system. Unfortunately, this implies we needed a method to ensure the path we provide to `Link` is valid.

Next.js has implemented a new feature in version `13.2` that introduces
[static typing for links](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-2#statically-typed-links) within the app
directory. This feature aims to prevent typographical errors or potential issues that may arise when
utilizing `next/link`.

Let's explore how we can implement this feature in a next.js app.

<Callout type="WARNING">
If you're initializing a Next.js app for the first time, make sure to specify that you want to
use Typescript alongside it by running `npx create-next-app my-awesome-app --ts`.
</Callout>

Imagine our application consisting of three routes, a home page, a contact page, and an about page.

Since the routing system in the **app** directory is managed based on the folders contained within it.
Structure the app folder as follows:

<Image alt={'App folder structure with a simple routing system in Next.js 13'} src={'/img/blog/1/1.webp'} width={1782â€Š} height={1005}
className="rounded-xl my-6 p-4 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-700" />

<Callout type="INFO">
For more information about how the routing system works in the new app directory, refer to
[Routing Fundamentals](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing) in the Next.js documentation.
</Callout>

Let's create a simple navigation within the `layout.tsx` file so we can navigate between our defined pages.

```tsx title="app/layout.tsx"
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
	return (
		<html lang="en">
			<body>
				<header>
					<h1><Link href="/">Next.js 13</Link></h1>
					<nav>
						<ul>
							<li><Link href={'/contact'}>Contact</Link></li>
							<li><Link href={'/about'}>About</Link></li>
					</nav>
				</header>
				{children}
			</body>
		</html>
	);
}
```

To demonstrate how statically typed routes work, let's add a new navigation item that currently does not
exist in our app. This way, we can simulate how the static typing feature can resolve such a scenario.

```tsx {7}
<header>
	<h1><Link href="/">Next.js - Statically typed links</Link></h1>
	<nav>
		<ul>
			<li><Link href={'/contact'}>Contact</Link></li>
			<li><Link href={'/about'}>About</Link</li>
			<li><Link href={'/blog'}>Blog</Link></li>
		</ul>
	</nav>
</header>
```

By default, TypeScript will not complain about errors related to the non-existent route during build
time. You won't receive any warnings in your text editor either (as shown in the screenshot below).

<Image alt={'Vercel Analytics}'} src={'/img/blog/1/2.webp'} width={1356} height={564}
className="rounded-xl my-6 border border-gray-100" />

This lack of type safety could lead to errors and bugs in the application.

## Experimental typed routes

<Callout type="WARNING">
Statically typed routes are still in beta and require the new **app** directory to work correctly.
</Callout>

Enabling this feature is easy to set up; add `typedRoutes: true` under the `experimental` field
in your **next.config.js** file.
```js
const nextConfig = {
	experimental: {
		typedRoutes: true,
        ...
	},
    ...
};
```

When `typedRoutes` is `true`, Next.js will create a type corresponding to all possible paths in
our application's link definition within the build source.

Since I'm using the `13.4` version on Next.js, I don't need to add `appDir` under the `experimental` field
since it's finally stable and can be adopted for production. However, If you're using an earlier version,
you must include it.
```js {3}
const nextConfig = {
	experimental: {
        appDir: true,
		typedRoutes: true,
        ...
	},
    ...
};
```
Now that TypeScript can leverage the link definition file, it can provide feedback within your
text editor to help catch any invalid links before you ship to production.

<Image alt={'Vercel Analytics}'} src={'/img/blog/1/3.webp'} width={1840} height={564}
className="rounded-xl my-6 border border-gray-100" />

<Callout type="INFO">
As a side note, re-run your server to generate the corresponding `.d.ts` file if you can't see the error immediately.

It's also worth mentioning that [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) are also supported.
</Callout>

## Statically type links for older versions
If you're Next.js application is running on an older version than `13.2`, you can use the open-source
[next-routes](https://github.com/tatethurston/nextjs-routes) package, which can also generate the route
types with zero configuration.

Install this package by running the following command:
```bash
# npm
npm install nextjs-routes
# yarn
yarn add nextjs-routes
# pnpm
pnpm add nextjs-routes
```

Update the **next.config.js** file to merge `next-routes` with the Next.js config.
```js {1,2,6}
const nextRoutes = require("nextjs-routes/config");
const withRoutes = nextRoutes();
const nextConfig = {
    ...
};
module.exports = withRoutes(nextConfig);
```

## Conclusion

With our new statically typed routes in place, we can now make changes to our app's folder structure without worrying much about breaking things in the production.

While this is still an experimental feature, it is worth exploring if you want to make the most of TypeScript.
