## What is PlanetScale?

[PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) is a super cool database-as-a-service platform based on
[Vitess](https://vitess.io/), the same technology that powers YouTube, Slack, and other mega-scale
companies. It gives you a serverless MySQL-compatible database with an awesome Git-like development
experience. Managing databases becomes a breeze with PlanetScale, and it scales like a champ while
delivering top-notch performance.

Here are some benefits of using PlanetScale:

- **Horizontal sharding:** Scale your data horizontally across multiple servers effortlessly.
- **Non-blocking schema changes:** Make schema changes without impacting or locking database availability.
- **Branching workflow:** Manage different branches for development, testing, and production
environments, just like Git.
- **Multiple regions:** Optimize performance by distributing your database closer to users in the
 different areas, reducing latency at the edge.

<Callout type="WARNING">
The PlanetScale hobby plan provides a single database with **one production** and **one development**
branch. If you require multiple development branches, such as for different environments, you must
upgrade your plan to accommodate them separately.

## Setup PlanetScale account and create your first database

To get started, we need to create a PlanetScale account. You have two options: visit the official website
and click the **Get Started** button or follow [this link](https://auth.planetscale.com/sign-up).

<AdaptiveImage alt={'PlanetScale signup page'} src={'/img/blog/3/1.webp'} width={768} height={719.06} />

You have two options for creating an account: sign up with your email and password or use your GitHub
account. In this tutorial, I'll be using the GitHub account signup method.

Upon signing up, you will receive a verification email. Click on the link within the email to confirm
your account, regardless of your chosen signup method.

<AdaptiveImage alt={'PlanetScale signup verification'} src={'/img/blog/3/2.webp'} width={768} height={719.06} />

Once you click on the confirmation link, you'll be taken through an onboarding flow that highlights the
amazing features of PlanetScale and provides guidance on how to use them. At the end of the flow,
you'll see a button that says, **Create your first database**. Click on it and give your database a name
(I'll go with **movies**).

<AdaptiveImage alt={'Create your first database on PlanetScale'} src={'/img/blog/3/3.webp'} width={768} height={719.06} />

<Callout type="WARNING">
Ensure that you choose the region closest to your serverless function. This selection will help in
minimizing latency and improving overall performance.
</Callout>

<Callout type="INFO">
Instead of using the dashboard, you can use the PlanetScale CLI to create your initial branch.
Run the following command: `pscale database create movies --region us-east`. We'll explore the
PlanetScale CLI in more detail, including its features and capabilities.
</Callout>

Once you've provided a name for your first database, PlanetScale will start the initialization process.
This may take a couple of minutes to complete.

After the initialization is done, you'll land on the homepage of your database. This page provides an
overview of your database and relevant details. It is the central hub for managing and interacting with
your database within the PlanetScale platform.

<AdaptiveImage alt={'PlanetScale dashboard'} src={'/img/blog/3/4.webp'} width={768} height={719.06} />

## PlanetScale CLI
The [PlanetScale CLI](https://planetscale.com/features/cli) is a handy command-line tool provided by
PlanetScale to make your life easier. Its user-friendly interface allows you to interact with your
PlanetScale databases, perform various operations, and seamlessly manage your databases, branches,
and deployments. With the CLI, you can execute schema changes, create deploy requests, and more
effortlessly. It's a valuable companion that streamlines your workflow and enhances your overall
experience with PlanetScale databases.

Using macOS, you can conveniently install the PlanetScale CLI using the
[Brew package manager](https://brew.sh/). Just run the following command:

```bash
brew install planetscale/tap/pscale
```

Please follow [the instructions](https://github.com/planetscale/cli#installation) for non-macOS users
to install the PlanetScale CLI on your respective operating system.

To confirm that the installation process was successful, you can run the following command:

```bash
pscale version
```

Upon running this command, you should see the version of your PlanetScale CLI printed in the terminal,
similar to the following output:

```bash
pscale version 0.146.0 (build date: 2023-06-06T15:12:18Z commit: 48fec66)
```

<Callout type="WARNING">
Before using commands like `pscale shell`, ensure MySQL is installed on your system. If you're using
macOS, you can install MySQL by running the following command: `brew install mysql-client`.
</Callout>

To authenticate and log in to your PlanetScale account using the CLI, execute the following command:

```bash
pscale auth login
```

After executing the command, a new browser tab will open and prompt you to sign in via the browser.
You will be asked to verify the device confirmation code displayed in your terminal.

<AdaptiveImage alt={'PlanetScale confirmation code'} src={'/img/blog/3/5.webp'} width={768} height={719.06} />

You should see a Successfully logged-in message displayed in your terminal once you clickthe
**Confirm code** button.

When we created a **movies** database in the previous section, it came with a default development
branch called **main**. As mentioned, you can have one production and one development branch in the
free plan. Let's promote the **main** branch as a production branch.

```bash
pscale branch promote movies main
```

Ensure that you enable **safe migrations** on your production branch as well. This will grant you or
your team the ability to create deploy requests.

<AdaptiveImage alt={'PlanetScale enable safe migrations'} src={'/img/blog/3/14.webp'} width={768} height={719.06} />

<Callout type="INFO">
A production branch adds an extra layer of protection for schema changes, just like a protected git
branch. It ensures that any modifications or schema changes must go through a pull request for review
and approval. This helps maintain the integrity and stability of the production environment.

[Read more about PlanetScale Branching](https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/branching)
</Callout>

<Callout type="INFO">
By default, the CLI is disabled for production branches, but you can enable it in your database settings
if desired. This gives you the flexibility to use the CLI for operations on your production branch
when necessary.

<AdaptiveImage alt={'PlanetScale activate console on production branches'} src={'/img/blog/3/6.webp'} width={768} height={719.06} />
</Callout>

Now, let's create a new **dev** branch for our development environment. This branch will be
specifically dedicated to our development work and experimentation.

```bash
pscale branch create movies dev
```

If you go to your PlanetScale dashboard, you can view the newly created **dev** branch listed among
your branches.

<AdaptiveImage alt={'PlanetScale branches list'} src={'/img/blog/3/7.webp'} width={768} height={719.06} />

Here are some other helpful `pscale` commands worth noting:

- `pscale shell`: Open a MySQL shell for a specific branch and database. Here, you can execute various
MySQL commands like `show databases`.
- `pscale database`: Manage the entire lifecycle of your database. Think of it as your database's CRUD
interface.
- `pscale branch`: Manage your branches and make schema changes.

These commands, among others, offer valuable functionality that can simplify your database management tasks.

See the complete command list with the documentation on
[PlanetScale CLI reference](https://planetscale.com/docs/reference/planetscale-cli#available-commands).

<Callout type="INFO">
You can directly access the PlanetScale CLI web console within your PlanetScale database. Go to
the Console tab and choose the dev branch.

<AdaptiveImage alt={'PlanetScale web console'} src={'/img/blog/3/8.webp'} width={768} height={719.06} />
</Callout>

## Create a TypeScript-based Next.js app

Create a new **Next.js** app by executing the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

During the installation process, you will encounter the following prompts:

```bash
Need to install the following packages:
  create-next-app@13.4.5
Ok to proceed? (y) y
✔ What is your project named? … favorite-movies
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript with this project? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to use ESLint with this project? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS with this project? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory with this project? … No / Yes
✔ Use App Router (recommended)? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to customize the default import alias? … No / Yes
```

Make sure to select the **TypeScript** option during the app creation process, and feel free to include
other technologies like ESLint and Tailwind CSS as per your needs.

Once you have responded to the prompts, the `create-next-app` command will create a new folder with the
specified project name and automatically install the required dependencies.

<Callout type="WARNING">
Utilizing the app router to leverage the latest features provided by Next.js is highly recommended.
</Callout>

To ensure the proper initialization of your app, run the following command in the root folder of your
project.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Connect your Next.js app to a PlanetScale database

Go to your PlanetScale dashboard and find the **dev** branch in the **Branches** tab. Click on
the **Connect** button located at the top right corner. You will be asked to choose a name for your
connection password. Leave the Branch and Role settings as they are by default.

<AdaptiveImage alt={'PlanetScale create database password'} src={'/img/blog/3/9.webp'} width={768} height={719.06} />

<Callout type="INFO">
In the same branch, you can create multiple passwords to manage access rights for different developers.
This gives you the flexibility to grant specific permissions based on their roles or requirements. By
creating various passwords, you can ensure that developers have the necessary access privileges while
maintaining security.

[Read more about the password roles concept](https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/password-roles)
</Callout>

Choose the **Connect with Node.js** option and securely save the provided string. This string will be
required when connecting your Next.js application to the PlanetScale database.

<AdaptiveImage alt={'PlanetScale connection string'} src={'/img/blog/3/10.webp'} width={768} height={719.06} />

<Callout type="WARNING">
Make sure to securely store these connection details, as PlanetScale automatically hides your password
once it is initially generated.
</Callout>

Create a `.env` file at the root of your project folder. In this file, store the database string
obtained from PlanetScale. This string will securely establish the connection between your project and
the PlanetScale database.

```bash
DATABASE_URL='mysql://41n034teqmu82iodgr83:pscale_pw_ImHo71aUxU6iC9Z2OY6CwyxlYuO5WoECi7xFDJAWTO6@aws.connect.psdb.cloud/movies?ssl={"rejectUnauthorized":true}'
```

<Callout type="WARNING">
Make sure to add the `.env` file to the `.gitignore` to prevent committing this file to source control, as it may
contain sensitive information.
</Callout>

## Drizzle ORM

[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) is a TypeScript ORM for SQL databases that prioritizes type
safety. It follows a familiar SQL-like syntax and catches errors at compile time. With Drizzle ORM, you
can enjoy the convenience of automatic SQL migrations and seamless integration with any TypeScript project.

Instead of manually creating tables using the PlanetScale CLI (`pscale shell`), we can define our table
schemas using Typescript interfaces. With the help of the
[Drizzle Kit](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/overview) (more on this later), we can effortlessly push
these defined tables into our PlanetScale database. This approach provides a convenient and efficient
way to manage and synchronize our table structures.

Let's begin by installing the following dependencies:

```bash
npm install @planetscale/database drizzle-orm
```

Next, we'll create a schema file called `schema.ts` within the `lib` folder.

```ts showLineNumbers title="lib/schema.ts"
import { InferModel } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { int, mysqlTable, serial, varchar } from 'drizzle-orm/mysql-core';

export const movies = mysqlTable('movies', {
	id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
	title: varchar('title', { length: 256 }).notNull(),
	releaseYear: int('releaseYear'),
	rating: int('rating'),
});

export type Movie = InferModel<typeof movies>;
```

Here, we are defining a schema for the `movies` table using the **mysql-core** package provided by drizzle-orm. This package offers the necessary data types to define our schema.

<Callout type="INFO">
- Feel free to use different names for the `schema.ts` file and the `lib` folder if you prefer. This is
just a common convention followed by the community.
- You can use different property names than the actual column names in the database. For instance, you
can define a property like `title: varchar('name', { length: 256 }).notNull()`. This allows you to
reference the column by using the `title` property instead of the actual column `name`.
</Callout>

Additionally, it is necessary to install [Drizzle Kit](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/overview), a CLI
tool that complements Drizzle ORM. Drizzle Kit enables the generation of migrations and facilitates
database prototyping.

Install it as a dev dependency ,as we will use it through the terminal.

```bash
npm install -D drizzle-kit
```

To configure Drizzle Kit, we need to create a Drizzle configuration file. This file specifies the schema
file location and the database connection URI. It enables Drizzle Kit to generate SQL prototyping and
migrations.

Create a new file named `drizzle.config.ts` in the root folder of your application:

```ts showLineNumbers title="drizzle.config.ts"
import type { Config } from 'drizzle-kit';

export default {
	schema: './lib/schema.ts',
	out: './drizzle-output',
	connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
} satisfies Config;
```

We specify the schema file, connection string, and the desired location for the generated migration file.

<Callout type="INFO">
You have the option to use separate files for each **schema** by modifying the schema property to
`schema: "./src/schema/*"`. This allows you to have individual schema files for each table in your
application.

```bash
└── lib
	    └── schema
		    └── movie.ts
		    └── actor.ts
```
</Callout>

The generated migration file will have an SQL extension and contain the SQL commands required to create
the table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE `movies` (
	`id` serial AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	`title` varchar(256) NOT NULL,
	`releaseYear` int,
	`rating` int DEFAULT 1);

```


The drizzle kit offers various commands, and we'll use the *push* command to push the **movies** table
into our PlanetScale database.

Add a new script called `db:push` in the list of scripts in your `package.json` file.

```json {8} showLineNumbers
{
	...
	"scripts": {
		"dev": "next dev",
		"build": "next build",
		"start": "next start",
		"lint": "next lint",
		"db:push": "drizzle-kit push:mysql --config=drizzle.config.ts"
	},
	"dependencies": {
		...
	},
	"devDependencies": {
		...
	}
}
```

Now, to execute the script, run the following command:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

You should see a successful message in your terminal indicating the changes have been applied.

Go to the PlanetScale dashboard and visit the "dev" branch. You will notice that our table has been
successfully created.

<AdaptiveImage alt={'PlanetScale database schema changes'} src={'/img/blog/3/11.webp'} width={768} height={719.06} />

Now, we will create some records using the PlanetScale CLI, specifically the integrated MySQL shell, to
demonstrate its functionality.

Run the following command:

```bash
pscale shell movies dev
```

This will prompt the shell. Here we can use a plain SQL language to create our first record:

```bash
INSERT INTO movies (title, releaseYear, rating) VALUES ('Scarface', 1983, 10);
```

Use the `SELECT` operation to check if the record has been successfully registered.

```bash
SELECT * FROM movies;
+----+----------+-------------+--------+
| id | title    | releaseYear | rating |
+----+----------+-------------+--------+
|  1 | Scarface |        1983 |     10 |
+----+----------+-------------+--------+
```

You can also see that the new record is displayed in the PlanetScale dashboard.

<AdaptiveImage alt={'PlanetScale dashboard statistics'} src={'/img/blog/3/12.webp'} width={768} height={719.06} />

<Callout type="WARNING">
Since the usage statistics displayed in the PlanetScale Dashboard are updated hourly, the record may take some
time to appear.
</Callout>

While utilizing an ORM such as Drizzle for query building is possible, it's essential to consider their
limitations, especially when dealing with complex queries. Additionally, these ORMs can impact performance.


Introducing [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/), A type-safe SQL query builder.

## Kysely Query builder

[Kysely](https://kysely.dev/) is a type-safe TypeScript SQL query builder that makes writing SQL queries
easier and less error-prone. It works seamlessly with TypeScript, providing autocompletion and type
safety based on your database schema. It supports popular databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite;
it also supports 3rd party dialects like PlanetScale and SurrealDB, eliminating the need for additional
engine binaries.

Install Kysely dependency by running the following command:

```bash
npm install kysely
```

We will also need to install the [PlanetScale dialect](https://github.com/depot/kysely-planetscale) for
the Kysely SQL query builder that enables compatibility with PlanetScale's MySQL-based database.

```bash
npm install kysely-planetscale
```

Create a new file called `kysely.js` in the `lib` folder and add the following code:

```ts showLineNumbers title="lib/kysely.ts"
import { Kysely } from 'kysely';
import { PlanetScaleDialect } from 'kysely-planetscale';
import { Kyselify } from 'drizzle-orm/kysely';
import { movies } from './schema';

interface Database {
	movies: Kyselify<typeof movies>;
}

export const queryBuilder = new Kysely<Database>({
	dialect: new PlanetScaleDialect({
		url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
	}),
});
```

We use the `kyselify` utility to register typescript interfaces to Kysely table objects.

We can now execute queries against the PlanetScale database with the dialect configured. In the next
section, we will create a simple user interface to display a list of movies retrieved from our database.

## Kysely in action

Let's create a simple UI for displaying a static movie list. Modify the content of the `page.tsx` file
located in the `app` folder to the following code snippet:

```tsx showLineNumbers
export default function Home() {
	return (
		<main>
			<div className="container">
				<div className="table">
					<div className="table-header">
						<div className="header__item">
							<span id="name" className="filter__link">
								Title
							</span>
						</div>
						<div className="header__item">
							<span className="filter__link">Release year</span>
						</div>
						<div className="header__item">
							<span className="filter__link">Rating</span>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div className="table-content">
						<div className="table-row">
							<div className="table-data">title example</div>
							<div className="table-data">2023</div>
							<div className="table-data">7</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</main>
	);
}
```

Please refer to [this file](https://github.com/ayoubkhial/fully-typed-next.js-planetscale-drizzle-kysely/blob/main/app/globals.css)
to get the CSS code. It's a little large and trivial to put here.

There are two approaches to using Kysely in a Next.js app. We can directly call it in the `app.tsx`
file or create an API endpoint that returns the movies and then call that endpoint in the `app.tsx`
file using the `fetch` method.

Let's start with the easy one, calling Kysely directly on `page.tsx`.

```tsx {4, 13-19} showLineNumbers
import { queryBuilder } from '@/lib/planetscale';

export default async function Home() {
	const movies = await queryBuilder.selectFrom('movies').selectAll().execute();
	return (
		<main>
			<div className="container">
				<div className="table">
					<div className="table-header">
						...
					</div>
					<div className="table-content">
						{movies.map((movie) => (
							<div className="table-row">
								<div className="table-data">{movie.title}</div>
								<div className="table-data">{movie.releaseYear}</div>
								<div className="table-data">{movie.rating}</div>
							</div>
						))}
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</main>
	);
}
```

As you can see, we call the `queryBuilder` from the server component directly and treat it as any
async function.

The Kysely SQL builder utilizes method chaining to compose SQL commands. To become familiar with the
syntax, you can use the [Kysely playground](https://kysely.dev/docs/playground). Additionally, you can
explore [these examples](https://kysely.dev/docs/category/examples) provided by Kysely to discover
more methods.

Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your web browser to see the list of movies retrieved from the database.

<AdaptiveImage alt={'Movies list'} src={'/img/blog/3/13.webp'} width={768} height={719.06} />

The approach described above is simpler and more straightforward for smaller applications. However,
for larger applications with complex data retrieval requirements, it is better to use the route API
approach to separate the database logic from the UI components, resulting in a more modular and
maintainable codebase. Additionally, using the API allows you to fully leverage the enhanced `fetch`
function, which provides caching capabilities, among other benefits.

Under the `api` folder, please create a new folder called `movies` and add a file named `route.ts`.

```bash
└── app
	    └── api
	        └── movies
		        └── route.ts
```

Since Next.js utilizes the folder structure to associate paths with each endpoint, any endpoint defined
inside the `route.ts` file will be accessed via the path `/api/movies`.

Let's add a `GET` method:

```ts showLineNumbers title="app/api/movies/route.ts"
import { queryBuilder } from '@/lib/planetscale';
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

const GET = async (_: NextRequest) => {
	const movies = await queryBuilder.selectFrom('movies').selectAll().execute();
	return NextResponse.json(movies);
};

export { GET };
```

We are using the same query builder command as on the `page.tsx` file.

Now, on the `page.tsx` file, we can use the `fetch` method to call this endpoint.
```tsx {3-13, 16} showLineNumbers
import { Movie } from '@/lib/schema';

const getMovies = async (): Promise<Movie[]> => {
	try {
		const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/movies`, {
			next: { revalidate: 3600 },
		});
		const movies: Movie[] = await response.json();
		return movies;
	} catch (error: any) {
		throw new Error(error.message);
	}
};

export default async function Home() {
	const movies = await getMovies();
	return (
		...
	);
}
```

You may notice the extra parameter we are passing to `fetch`. This parameter is not supported by the
native `fetch` method. Next.js extends the `fetch` options object to enable each request to set its own
caching and revalidating.

<Callout type="WARNING">
By default, when the `revalidate` property is not set in the `fetch` method, the fetched data is
automatically cached indefinitely, meaning subsequent requests for the same data will be served from
the cache without making additional network requests.
</Callout>

<Callout type="INFO">
You can use the `cache: 'no-store'` option to ensure that new data is fetched on every fetch request
and prevent caching. By setting this option, each request will bypass the cache and retrieve the latest
data directly from the server.
</Callout>

## Deploying to Vercel

The **dev** branch now holds our initial schema. Let's create a **deploy request** to push these changes
to the **main** production branch.

```bash
pscale deploy-request create movies dev
```

If everything goes smoothly, you will see a success message with a link to the details of the deployment
request.

```bash
Deploy request #1 successfully created.

View this deploy request in the browser: https://app.planetscale.com/ayoub-khial/movies/deploy-requests/1
```

Click on the link to redirect you to the deploy request details. From there, you can deploy the changes
or close the request.

<AdaptiveImage alt={'PlanetScale deploy request'} src={'/img/blog/3/15.webp'} width={768} height={719.06} />

Click on the deploy changes button, and after a few seconds, you'll see a message indicating the
deployment was completed successfully.

<AdaptiveImage alt={'PlanetScale request deployed successfully'} src={'/img/blog/3/16.webp'} width={768} height={719.06} />

If you navigate to your main branch, you will find the newly created movies table.

<AdaptiveImage alt={'PlanetScale branch schema changes'} src={'/img/blog/3/17.webp'} width={768} height={719.06} />

To set up your project on Vercel, commit it to Github and sync it with Vercel. Then, go to the
**Settings** tab and select **Environment Variables** from the left menu. From there, please create a
new variable for the production environment, similar to what you did in the `.env` file.


But before that, get the database string from PlanetScale just like we did with the **dev** branch. But
this time you need to get it from the **main** branch.

<AdaptiveImage alt={'Vercel environment variables'} src={'/img/blog/3/18.webp'} width={768} height={719.06} />

<Callout type="WARNING">
It's essential to name your variable the same name as you named it in the `.env` file, in our case,
`DATABASE_URL`.
</Callout>

You're all set! Your database schema is now synchronized between your branches, and each branch is
accountable for a particular environment.


## Conclusion

The synergy between **Next.js**, **PlanetScale**, **Drizzle ORM**, and **Kysely** is a winning
combination for creating scalable and fully typed applications. These tools offer the flexibility and
power needed to build robust and efficient database-driven applications.
