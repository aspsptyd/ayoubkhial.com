## Introduction
If you've been following our series, you know we've covered a lot of ground, from building a robust Express.js architecture to using environment variables for better portability in your Node.js app. But now, as we move on to our 6th part, we're kicking things up a notch!

In this article, we will explore the heart of any web application: the database. Specifically, we'll discuss [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/), an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and Node.js. With **Mongoose**, you can define objects with a strongly typed schema mapped to a MongoDB collection. Additionally, we will introduce [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database), which will host our MongoDB and make it easier than ever to manage our database.

<Callout>
Express applications provide a versatile platform that seamlessly integrates with any database compatible with Node.js. This leaves you many options, including industry leaders like **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **Redis**, **SQLite**, and **MongoDB**.

For more information on the available options, Visit the [Database integration section in the official Express documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/database-integration.html).

## Introduction to MongoDB - A NoSQL Database
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a NoSQL database, which means it doesn't rely on the traditional table-based relational database structure. Instead, it uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. This allows for a more dynamic and flexible data model, well-suited for modern applications where data structures can evolve over time.

<Image alt={'SQL VS NoSQL - Storage and Terminology'} filename={'mean-web-app-part-6-introduction-to-mongodb-and-mongoose/1.webp'} />

MongoDB has several important features, making it a popular choice for storing and managing data:

- **Schemaless:** No predefined schema is necessary, offering more flexibility to store complex data structures.
- **Horizontal Scalability:** Easily scales out by adding more machines in the cluster.
- **High Performance:** Built-in caching and optimized querying through indexing.
- **Document-Oriented:** A good fit for object-oriented programming models as data records are stored in a document format.

But why We chose MongoDB for our app:

- **Complex Queries Made Simple:** Tracking issues involve multiple attributes like status, priority, assignee, and more. MongoDB's powerful querying capabilities let you execute complex queries efficiently, making it easier to filter, sort, and manage tasks in real time. You can quickly generate reports and dashboards that offer insights into project health, work progress, and team productivity.
- S**calability:** As your projects grow, so do your data storage needs. MongoDB's horizontal scalability can effortlessly handle an increase in workload by adding more nodes to the existing cluster. This ensures that your issue-tracking system remains responsive and capable, regardless of the project's size.
- **Real-time Collaboration:** MongoDB supports real-time data synchronization, essential for a collaborative environment. Team members can see updates, comments, and status changes in real-time, enhancing the responsiveness and effectiveness of the issue-tracking system.
- **Data Aggregation and Analytics:** MongoDB's aggregation framework is potent, allowing for the analysis of data right within the database. This is beneficial for creating complex analytical queries that help evaluate project timelines, team performance, and other critical KPIs for project management.
- **Integration with Existing Technologies:** Since MongoDB works well with JavaScript and JSON-like documents, it easily integrates with frontend and backend technologies commonly used in issue-tracking applications, such as Node.js and Express. This seamless integration ensures you can focus more on building functionalities than worrying about data translation and transfer.

MongoDB's flexibility, scalability, and performance make it an exceptional choice for our issue-tracking application. Combined with Node.js and Express, it forms a streamlined, efficient tech stack where each component amplifies the others' strengths. This synergy simplifies development and yields robust, scalable, high-performing web applications.

## Mongoose, an ODM for MongoDB
<Image alt={'Mongoose ODM component in a web app.'} filename={'mean-web-app-part-6-introduction-to-mongodb-and-mongoose/2.webp'} />

[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. Think of it as a layer on top of the native [MongoDB driver](xhttps://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/), providing a neat abstraction and a set of features to work with your MongoDB collections. With **Mongoose**, you can define a strongly typed schema for your collections, thereby enforcing a structure on your data. It translates data in the MongoDB database to JavaScript objects for your application.

<Callout>
**ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)** is geared toward relational databases like **MySQL**, mapping tables to classes and abstracting SQL queries. In contrast, **ODM (Object-Document Mapping)** is designed for NoSQL databases like **MongoDB**, mapping collections to classes. Each serves as a bridge between your application and a different type of database.
</Callout>

You may wonder, with MongoDB's native driver already so powerful, why add an additional layer like Mongoose? Well, Mongoose does more than act as a bridge between your application and MongoDB. Below are some compelling reasons why you might want to use Mongoose in your Node.js application:

- **Schema Validation:** Imagine creating a system where you manually validate the data types, structure, and nested objects each time you insert or update a document. Not only is it time-consuming, but it's also prone to errors. Mongoose alleviates this issue by allowing you to define a strongly-typed schema for your collections. This ensures data consistency and helps you catch bugs early in development. You can extend this validation with custom logic to meet specific business requirements.

```typescript
const UserSchema = new Schema({
	username: { type: String, required: true },
	email: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
	password: { type: String, minlength: 8 }
});
```

- **Type Casting:** Data can come in various forms and types. Mongoose excels at automatically casting data to fit your schema. Suppose you define a field as a number in your schema. In that case, Mongoose will attempt to convert a string that looks like a number into an actual number type, saving you the headache of manual data transformation.

```typescript
const user = new UserModel({ username: 'ayoubkhial', age: '28' });
// The age registred in the user is converted to number
console.log(typeof user.age); // output: Number
```

- **Middleware and Hooks:** One of the most potent features of Mongoose is its middleware capabilities, allowing you to hook into various stages of a document's lifecycle. These hooks, also known as pre and post-middleware, enable you to run asynchronous functions before or after certain events. For example, you can hash a password before storing it or update related records after a document is deleted.

```typescript
UserSchema.pre('save', async function() {
	this.password = await hashPassword(this.password);
});
```

- **Expressive Query API:** The Mongoose query API is expressive and easy to use. It provides a chainable interface to build complex queries without sacrificing readability. The API is designed to be intuitive, making it easier to perform queries like finding, updating, or deleting records. Additionally, it offers built-in utilities for pagination, sorting, and field selection.

```typescript
const users = await User.find().sort({ createdAt: -1 }).limit(10).exec();
```

- **Extensibility through Plugins:** Mongoose has a vibrant ecosystem of plugins that you can incorporate to extend its functionality. From full-text search capabilities to pagination helpers, the Mongoose plugin allows you to add features without modifying the core codebase. You can even create your own plugins to solve unique challenges.

```typescript
import autopopulate from 'mongoose-autopopulate'; 
UserSchema.plugin(autopopulate);
```

- **Strong TypeScript Support:** Mongoose offers excellent type support. You can easily define interfaces for your models, providing all the benefits of type checking and IntelliSense code completion. This enhances code quality, readability, and maintainability, making your development process more efficient and enjoyable.

```typescript
interface IUser extends Document {
    username: string;
    email: string;
    password: string;
}

const User: Model<IUser> = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
```

In summary, Mongoose offers a robust set of features that go beyond basic database interaction. It provides a structured framework for your MongoDB database operations, making writing secure, readable, and maintainable code easier, letting you focus on writing business logic rather than boilerplate code.

## Host your database on the cloud with MongoDB Atlas
While there are several options for hosting MongoDB, **MongoDB Atlas** stands out as the go-to cloud-based solution. This service offers a hassle-free setup and features like automated backups, scaling, and security measures right out of the box.

[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) is designed to run on major cloud providers like **AWS**, **Azure**, and **GCP**, ensuring your data is readily available and distributed across multiple geographical locations. This geographic distribution not only enhances performance but also provides high availability.

Below are some key features and aspects that make MongoDB Atlas a popular choice for businesses and developers.

- **Scalability:** Automatic scaling features mean your database can grow alongside your application. You can focus on building out features without worrying about database limitations.
- **Fully-Managed Service:** MongoDB Atlas provides automated backups, monitoring, and upgrades. You don't need to worry about maintenance tasks, freeing your team to focus on development.
- **Security:** With features like IP Whitelisting, data encryption, and automated backups, MongoDB Atlas ensures your data is secure and accessible only to authorized personnel.
- **Global Distribution:** MongoDB Atlas allows you to deploy your database instances in data centers worldwide, ensuring low latency and high availability for your application.
- **Integration with Modern Development Stacks:** Being a cloud-native platform, MongoDB Atlas offers a RESTful API and integrates well with other cloud services and containerization platforms like Kubernetes. For Node.js developers, it offers native support for Mongoose, the object data modeling (ODM) library, making it easier to use MongoDB Atlas in Node.js applications.

<Callout>
You're not restricted to using a cloud-based MongoDB service; you can absolutely opt for a local MongoDB setup if that aligns better with your project's needs or preferences.

For guidance, check out the [official MongoDB installation manual](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/).
</Callout>

A cluster in MongoDB Atlas is a managed set of servers that work together to provide a unified data storage and processing service. A single cluster can host multiple databases and their respective collections and documents.

To set up a cluster on MongoDB Atlas, [create an account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) on their website if you haven't already. After completing the sign-up, you'll encounter a pop-up that will guide you through some questions about your application.

<Image alt={'MongoDB Atlas - Cluster app information'} filename={'mean-web-app-part-6-introduction-to-mongodb-and-mongoose/3.webp'} />

Make sure to select the Free tier, as this plan offers a robust set of resources and features that perfectly meet the requirements of our ongoing project (See more about plans). Next, choose your preferred cloud service provider—either AWS, Azure, or GCP—and select the geographical location where your cluster will be hosted. If you're unsure about any settings, feel free to stick with the default configurations, as these can be modified later. Lastly, assign a name to your cluster, such as **'aws-dev'**, to help you quickly identify it within your MongoDB Atlas dashboard.

<Image alt={'MongoDB Atlas - Setup cluster Plane, Provider, Region and Name'} filename={'mean-web-app-part-6-introduction-to-mongodb-and-mongoose/4.webp'} />

Now, you need to create your first user. By default, this initial user will have **read** and **write** access to all databases, serving a role similar to that of a **root user**. It's worth noting that these permissions are flexible and can be adjusted later.

<Image alt={'MongoDB Atlas - Setup Cluster username and password'} filename={'mean-web-app-part-6-introduction-to-mongodb-and-mongoose/5.webp'} />

<Callout type="WARNING">
Ensure to securely store the password, as you'll need it later to connect your MongoDB Atlas cluster to your application. Although I've shared my password here as an example, I plan to remove the cluster, so don't follow my lead—never share your password publicly.
</Callout>

Finally, you can grant access to specific API addresses as you see fit. Note that your current IP address will be included by default, but this setting can be customized later.

<Image alt={'MongoDB Atlas - Setup cluster IP Access List'} filename={'mean-web-app-part-6-introduction-to-mongodb-and-mongoose/6.webp'} />

<Callout>
You can grant global network access to your cluster by adding the IP address range `0.0.0.0/0`.
</Callout>

You should now be able to view the overview page of your cluster, where you'll find essential details and configurations related to your MongoDB Atlas setup. This dashboard will be your central hub for managing, monitoring, and interacting with your cluster.

<Image alt={'MongoDB Atlas - Dashboard overview'} filename={'mean-web-app-part-6-introduction-to-mongodb-and-mongoose/7.webp'} />

## Connecting MongoDB Cluster to Node.js Application
Establishing a connection between a MongoDB Atlas cluster and a Node.js application involves several steps. First, you'll need to configure your cluster on MongoDB Atlas. Next, install the necessary Node.js packages for the database connection. Finally, you'll integrate this connection into your app's codebase.

To obtain your connection string, navigate to your cluster's overview page and click the **'Connect'** button. You'll then be guided through various connection options—choose the **'Connect your application using Drivers'** method.

<Image alt={'MongoDB Atlas - Connection method'} filename={'mean-web-app-part-6-introduction-to-mongodb-and-mongoose/8.webp'} />

Select Node.js as your preferred driver and copy the ensuing connection string, which will resemble the following format:

```text
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-name>.xxxxxxx.mongodb.net/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

<Image alt={'MongoDB Atlas - Connecting with MongoDB Driver'} filename={'mean-web-app-part-6-introduction-to-mongodb-and-mongoose/9.webp'} />

Remember to swap out `<password>` with the password you assigned to your MongoDB user.

As discussed earlier, we'll utilize [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose) as our 
go-to Object Document Mapper (ODM) to facilitate smooth interactions with MongoDB. To get started, 
run the following installation command:

```bash
pnpm add mongoose --filter server
```

<Callout>
If you're not working with MongoDB, other ODM/ORM libraries are specifically designed for various databases. For instance, **Sequelize** is a robust choice for those using relational databases like **MySQL**. On the other hand, **Dynamoose** is well-suited for **AWS DynamoDB**. These alternatives offer features similar to Mongoose, making database operations smooth and manageable.
</Callout>

In the **providers** directory, create a new folder named **database** that will serve as the central location for all database-related operations, such as establishing connections, handling errors, and implementing customizations.

Create an **index.ts** file inside your newly established **database** folder. This file will function as the gateway to your database module, coordinating everything from connections to other database-specific operations.

```typescript showLineNumbers title="src/providers/database/index.ts"
import { connect as mongoConnect } from 'mongoose';

const connect = async (): Promise<void> => {
	const URI = `mongodb+srv://akhial:nRsWLncbo2QiHtEl@$aws-dev.dbfplfg.mongodb.net/bugsight?retryWrites=true&w=majority`;
	try {
		const connection = await mongoConnect(URI);
		console.log(`MongoDB connected: ${connection.connection.name}`);
	} catch (error) {
		if (error instanceof Error) {
			console.log(error);
		}
	}
};

export { connect };
```

<Callout>
If you don't specify a database name, Mongoose will default to using **'test'** as a name for your database. To use a different database, append its name to the connection string before the `?retryWrites=true` parameter. For instance, Mongoose will automatically create a new database called **'bugsight'** upon the initial connection in my setup.
</Callout>

Here, we are hardcoding the Connection String directly in the code; this is generally discouraged for several reasons. The most significant issue is its security risk; if the codebase is ever exposed or compromised, so are your sensitive database credentials. This can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Also, hardcoded strings make managing changes or updates to your database credentials or configurations difficult, especially in multi-environment applications. Whenever you need to change the connection details, you'd have to manually update the code and redeploy the application, which is cumbersome and error-prone.

Instead, we can use environment variables for storing database connection string; keeping sensitive data like credentials outside the codebase minimizes the risk of accidental exposure and data breaches.

You have the option to store your connection string in a single variable:

```text title="src/env/.env"
...
DB_URI=mongodb+srv://akhial:nRsWLncbo2QiHtEl@$aws-dev.dbfplfg.mongodb.net/bugsight?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Alternatively, you can split the connection string into individual environment variables for enhanced security and manageability.

```text title="src/env/.env"
...
DB_USERNAME=akhial
DB_PASSWORD=nRsWLncbo2QiHtEl
DB_CLUSTER=aws-dev
DB_NAME=bugsight
```

This approach offers greater flexibility, allowing you to manage each variable independently without impacting the others, making it easier to update or secure specific parts of your connection settings.

<Callout>
For those running MongoDB locally, your connection URI looks like this:`mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/bugsight`.
</Callout>

In your **index.ts** file within the env folder, include these variables. This ensures TypeScript is aware of them, which aids in type-checking and autocompletion.

```typescript {3-8,15-20} title="src/env/index.ts"
interface NodeEnvironment {
	...
	db: {
		username: string;
		password: string;
		cluster: string;
		name: string;
	};
}

const env = process.env;

const environment: NodeEnvironment = {
	...
	db: {
		username: env.DB_USERNAME!,
		password: env.DB_PASSWORD!,
		cluster: env.DB_CLUSTER!,
		name: env.DB_NAME
	}
};
```

Adjust the `connect` function to make use of the newly established environment variables.

```typescript showLineNumbers {1,5} title="src/providers/database/index.ts"
import environment from '../../env';
import { connect as mongoConnect } from 'mongoose';

const connect = async (): Promise<void> => {
	const { db: { username, password, cluster, name } } = environment;
	const URI = `mongodb+srv://${username}:${password}@${cluster}.dbfplfg.mongodb.net/${name}?retryWrites=true&w=majority`;
	// The rest of the code remains the same
};

export { connect };
```

We can enhance our connection monitoring by leveraging Mongoose's connection events. These events offer real-time updates on the connection's status, delivering benefits like more precise error handling and optimal connection management.

```typescript {5-7,9-11,13-15} showLineNumbers title="src/providers/database/index.ts"
const connect = async (): Promise<void> => {
	const { db: { username, password, cluster, name } } = environment;
	const URI = `mongodb+srv://${username}:${password}@${cluster}.dbfplfg.mongodb.net/${name}?retryWrites=true&w=majority`;

	mongoose.connection.on('connected', () => {
		console.log(`MongoDB connected: ${name}`);
	});

	mongoose.connection.on('error', (err) => {
		console.log(`Mongoose connection error: ${err?.message}`);
	});

	mongoose.connection.on('disconnected', () => {
		console.log('Mongoose disconnected');
	});

	try {
		await mongoConnect(URI);
	} catch (error) {
		if (error instanceof Error) {
			console.log(error);
		}
	}
};
```

Using events for managing database connections offers several advantages. It grants finer control by triggering actions based on the connection's status, whether established, encounters an error, or is terminated. This leads to more graceful error handling, enabling actions like retries or detailed logging.

<Callout>
You might have noticed the frequent use of `console.log` throughout the code. Rest assured, we'll explore more sophisticated logging and error-handling techniques in later articles.

Numerous events are available for subscription, some more commonly used than others. For the complete list, see [this link](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/blob/master/lib/connection.js).
</Callout>

Another key aspect to discuss is **connection options**. While a single connection string can suffice for basic MongoDB connections, more complex scenarios may require customization for improved performance, security, or reliability. Using a connection options object offers greater control in these situations.

You may have noticed that we're embedding connection options directly within the URI (`?retryWrites=true&w=majority`). Let's refactor this by using an options object instead.

```typescript title="src/providers/database/index.ts"
import mongoose, { ConnectOptions, connect as mongoConnect } from 'mongoose';

const connect = async (): Promise<void> => {
	const { db: { username, password, cluster, name } } = environment;
	const URI = `mongodb+srv://${username}:${password}@${cluster}.dbfplfg.mongodb.net/${name}?retryWrites=true&w=majority`;
	const options: ConnectOptions = {
		writeConcern: { w: 'majority' },
		retryWrites: true
	};

	...

	try {
		await mongoConnect(URI, options);
	} catch (error) {
		if (error instanceof Error) {
			console.log(error);
		}
	}
};
```

Using a connection options object in a MongoDB connection enhances code robustness through TypeScript's type safety, catching errors at compile-time and simplifying updates.

<Callout>
There are numerous options to explore, and while some may be deprecated, TypeScript's IDE integration can alert you to such issues.

For a complete list of available options, refer to [the MongoDB Official Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/fundamentals/connection/connection-options/).
</Callout>

Finally, let's call this method from the main **index.ts** file to establish our database connection.

```typescript {2, 5} showLineNumbers title="src/index.ts"
import * as server from './providers/server';
import * as database from './providers/database';

(async () => {
	await Promise.all([database.connect(), server.start()]);
})();
```

Run your server, and if everything is set up correctly, you should see the message **'MongoDB connected: bugsight'** displayed in your terminal.

## Visualize your MongoDB Data
Visualizing your MongoDB data can provide invaluable insights into your application's performance and streamline debugging and query optimization.

But first, let's create some dummy data; below your connection, we'll create a new model(collection) named **character** with one document.

```typescript {7-13} title="src/providers/database/index.ts"
import mongoose, { ConnectOptions, connect as mongoConnect } from 'mongoose';

const connect = async (): Promise<void> => {
	...
	try {
		await mongoConnect(URI, options);
		const characterSchema = new mongoose.Schema({}, { strict: false });
		const CharacterModel = mongoose.model('character', characterSchema);
		const character = new CharacterModel({
			name: 'Goku',
			power: 'Kamehameha'
		});
		await character.save();
	} catch (error) {
		if (error instanceof Error) {
			console.log(error);
		}
	}
};
```

<Callout>
There are better ways to interact with your database than this current approach. In an upcoming article, we'll dive deeply into Mongoose's best practices and how to optimally structure your DAO.
</Callout>

If you restart the server, a new collection named `characters`(Mongoose automatically pluralizes the model name) should be created, containing a single document.

Please navigate to the MongoDB Atlas dashboard for a visual overview of our data. Once there, go to the **Deployment** section and click **Database**. Next, click **Browse Collections** to explore the newly created collection and examine its associated document.

<Image alt={'MongoDB Atlas - Visualize your MongoDB data'} filename={'mean-web-app-part-6-introduction-to-mongodb-and-mongoose/10.webp'} w />

You'll notice the **'characters'** collection is created. You'll find a document in this collection that mirrors the object we've saved (actually, there are 5 documents since I restarted the server multiple times!), along with some additional fields. We'll explore these extra attributes in more detail in a future article.

<Image alt={'MongoDB Atlas - Database collections and documents'} filename={'mean-web-app-part-6-introduction-to-mongodb-and-mongoose/11.webp'} />

<Callout>
There are two additional popular methods for visualizing your MongoDB data: you can use a GUI application such as [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass) or Robo 3T or leverage the power of the new [Atlas CLI](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-announces-new-atlas-cli).
</Callout>

## Conclusion
In conclusion, **MongoDB** offers a flexible and robust solution for database management, especially when paired with **Node.js**. Through the course of this article, we've explored how to set up a MongoDB database with **MongoDB Atlas**, leverage the power of **Mongoose** as an ODM, connect it to a Node.js application, and visualize the stored data. Whether you're building a small project or an enterprise-grade application, these tools provide a solid foundation for your backend infrastructure.
