## Introduction
In the intricate world of coding, aesthetics often serve more than mere visual pleasure. A soothing 
and adaptable interface is paramount as developers spend countless hours staring at their screens. One 
crucial aspect of this environment is the code theme, which dictates the color and style of the text 
and background that programmers work with daily. A theme that supports both light and dark modes 
allows customization according to individual preferences and can contribute to reduced eye strain, 
increased productivity, and a more pleasurable coding experience. Moving towards a more inclusive and 
adaptable design, we have curated a collection of 23 remarkable code themes that embrace light and 
dark modes. These themes transcend aesthetics, allowing developers to tailor their working environment 
to their comfort, mood, or even the time of day.

## How to automatically switch themes
Before starting with our curated collection, add the following fields to use user settings to 
automatically switch between light and dark themes in Visual Studio Code based on the operating 
system's appearance preferences.

```json
{
    "window.autoDetectColorScheme": true,
    "workbench.preferredLightColorTheme": "Github Light",
    "workbench.preferredDarkColorTheme": "Github Dark",
    ...
}
```

- `"window.autoDetectColorScheme": true`: This enables VS Code to automatically detect and switch between light and dark color schemes based on the operating system's settings.
- `"workbench.preferredLightColorTheme": "Github Light"`: This sets the preferred light theme to "Github Light." When the operating system uses a light appearance, VS Code will switch to this theme.
- `"workbench.preferredDarkColorTheme": "Github Dark"`: Similarly, this sets the preferred dark theme to "Github Dark." VS Code will switch to this theme when the operating system uses a dark appearance.

If you want more control to switch modes, a handy extension called 
[Toggle Light/Dark Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=danielgjackson.auto-dark-mode-windows) 
provides a quick toggle between light/dark themes in VS Code using our already-defined settings.

<Callout type="INFO">
Remember that using the same theme for both light and dark modes is unnecessary. You have the 
flexibility to mix and match according to your preferences.
